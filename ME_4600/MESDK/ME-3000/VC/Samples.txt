The projects using following files:
me3000.h            header file for static DLL access
me3000.lib          library file for static DLL access
meDefs.h            definitions
DLLInit.cpp         source file for dynamic DLL access
DLLInit.h           header file for dynamic DLL access
meDefs.h            used by DLLInit.cpp


The programs uses dynamic function calls
and Wrappers for all the ME3000 functions
All Function names can be used exactly as
they are described in the ME3000 handbook


dynamic vs. static binding of a DLL:
------------------------------------

static binding:
    - you have to include the me3000.lib file
      in the project workspace
    - then you can use every function in the DDL
      like a locally existing function
      (with the appropriate prototypes)
    - in some cases there are problems with
      different compiler versions !!!

dynamic binding:
    - you have to open a DLL with
      "LoadLibrary"
    - you have to get a function pointer with
      "GetProcAddress"
    - then you can use every DLL exported
      function with its function pointer

In this samples we have done most of the
steps for you:
If you would like to use static binding:
    - include the lib file
    - use the include file me3000.h
    - use the compiler MS Visual C 6.00
If you would like to use dynamic binding:
      (All the following steps are done in
      this example:)
    - use the include file DLLInit.h
    - use the function meOpen at the
      start of the program
    - use the function meClose at the
      end of the program
    - include the source code file
      "DLLInit.cpp" in the project.  This
      file contains the "meOpen" and
      "meClose" functions which must be
      called from the main program.  The
      "meOpen" function opens the library
      and gets the address of all the DLL
      functions.  The "meClose" function
      simply closes the library at the end of
      the program.
    - The source code file "DLLInit" also
      has all of the "Wrapper" functions.  This
      allows the user to use the full and proper
      function names when calling them from the
      main program.


The static projects are tested with Visual
C++ 6.0 (professional edition) only.
For other compilers you have to use dynamic
binding.
The C sources are for use with Borland C++
and Visual C++ programs.

The example programs are shiped as is and Meilhaus
Electronic offers no guarantees.
