In this directory is the following simple example:

sample01	General Example with dynamic DLL access
sample02	General Example with static DLL access (using a lib file)

This is not a full working sample, it should show 
how you can access the board in a C environment.

The projects are written for Visual C 6.0 or 
Borland C Builder 4 only. (But should run also 
under higher versions)

If you have improvement proposals for the sample,
please send it to software@meilhaus.de

The example programs are shiped as is and Meilhaus 
Electronic offers no guarantees.
