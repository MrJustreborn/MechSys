This is a simple test:

Connect the a input pin with a output pin.
(such as pin 1 an pin 12)
Connect the power supply.
(pin 9 with ground and pin 10 with VCC)
Start the test program.
Set Int on bit change
Set Enable Int
Set Tristate off
Set Source Mode
Set Mask with the appropriate pin
(the connected one: pin 0)
Set Word with apropriate pin
Then a interrupt should occur

Of course you can use a external signal:
Connect the a input pin with 
appropriate signal.
(such as pin 1)
Connect the power supply.
(pin 9 with ground and pin 10 with VCC)
Start the test program.
Set Int on bit change
Set Enable Int
Set Tristate off
Set Source Mode
Set Mask with the appropriate pin
(the connected one: pin 0)
Now you can generate interrupts with 
the external signal.
