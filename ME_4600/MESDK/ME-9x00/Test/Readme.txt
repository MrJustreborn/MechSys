There are no special test programs
for the ME-9100 needed. 
A simple test program is in this directory.
Also you can test the ports with the Hyper 
Terminal from the MS Windows operating
system (Under Windows 95/98/ME the Hyper 
Terminal has limitations regarding the 
number of suported ports, only 1 to 4)
You should connect two COM 
ports with a NULL Modem cable.
Then you have to open one of the test (*)
programs for every port (two times). 
Now you can transfer files 
or single keyboard letters.

(*) First try the test program in this 
directory.
Also you can use the terminal program
included in the terminal directory or
the hyper terminal.
