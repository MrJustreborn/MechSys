in the same way as any other standard COM port under 
Windows NT/95/98. For more information the user should 
refer to the information from Microsoft concerning the 
WIN32 communications API, in particular the article 
"Serial Communications in Win32" by Allen Denver on 
the MSDN library, or to one of the many books which 
cover this aspect of WIN32 programming.

 
The projects are tested with Visual C++ 6.0 
(professional edition) only.
